  of a namespace and loaded via (er/defsession session-name 'namespace) pattern.

  ;; Rich Test Fixture (RTF) - Instructions for testing clara-xlsx-diff rules
  ;;
  ;; These rules compare v1 and v2 versions of XLSX files and detect:
  ;;   ‚úÖ MATCH: cells with same values in both versions
  ;;   üîÑ CHANGED: cells with different values between versions  
  ;;   ‚ùå DELETED: cells present in v1 but missing in v2
  ;;   ‚ûï ADDED: cells present in v2 but missing in v1
  ;;
  ;; === STEP 1: Load required namespaces ===
  (require '[clara-xlsx-diff.xlsx :as xlsx])
  (require '[clara-xlsx-diff.eav :as custom-eav])
  (require '[clara-eav.rules :as er])
  (require '[clara.rules :as rules])
  
  ;; === STEP 2: Load sample data from v1 and v2 files ===
  (def v1-data (xlsx/extract-data "test/sample_data.xlsx"))
  (def v2-data (xlsx/extract-data "test/sample_data_2.xlsx"))
  
  ;; === STEP 3: Convert to EAV triples with version tags ===
  (def eav-v1 (custom-eav/xlsx->eav v1-data :version :v1))
  (def eav-v2 (custom-eav/xlsx->eav v2-data :version :v2))
  
  ;; Verify the data format:
  (println "V1 sample EAV:" (first eav-v1))
  (println "V2 sample EAV:" (first eav-v2))
  (println "V1 count:" (count eav-v1) "V2 count:" (count eav-v2))
  
  ;; === STEP 4: Create session and load both versions ===
  (er/defsession diff-session 'clara-xlsx-diff.rules)
  (def session (-> diff-session
                   (er/upsert eav-v1)          ; Load v1 data
                   (er/upsert eav-v2)          ; Load v2 data
                   (rules/fire-rules)))        ; Fire all diff rules
  
  ;; === Expected Output ===
  ;; You should see output like:
  ;;   ‚úÖ MATCH: Employees A1 = Name (unchanged between v1 and v2)
  ;;   üîÑ CHANGED: Employees B2 : Alice Johnson ‚Üí Alice Smith
  ;;   ‚ùå DELETED: Employees C3 was 75000.0 (missing in v2)
  ;;   ‚ûï ADDED: Employees D4 = New Value (new in v2)
  ;;
  ;; === STEP 5: Experiment with rules ===
  ;; Try modifying the sample files and re-running to see different diff patterns.
  ;; Add more rules for specific analysis needs (e.g., salary changes, new employees).
