(comment
  ;; NOTE: Usage patterns differ between Browser and Node.js:
  ;;
  ;; BROWSER USAGE (with File input):
  ;; - User selects file via <input type="file">
  ;; - Get File object from input.files[0]
  ;; - Use extract-data-from-file with the File object
  ;;
  ;; NODE.JS USAGE (with file paths):
  ;; - Use extract-data with a file path string
  ;; - Node.js will read the file using fs module
  ;;
  ;; Example for Node.js:
  (def file-buffer (create-file-buffer "test/sample_data.xlsx"))
  (def extracted-data (extract-data file-buffer))
  ;;
  ;; Example for Browser:
  ;; (extract-data-from-file file-object-from-input)


  ;; For use with base64 data:
  ;; (let [data (extract-data base64-string)]
  ;;   (js/console.log "Sheet count:" (:sheet-count data)))
  )
